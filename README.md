# go-grpc-template

A minimal Go microservice template using **gRPC**, designed with **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)** principles.

## ðŸ§± Project Architecture: Hexagonal Style

This project follows the **Hexagonal Architecture (aka Ports and Adapters)**, which helps in separating business logic from infrastructure and delivery mechanisms.

### ðŸ’¡ What is Hexagonal Architecture?

Also known as **Ports and Adapters**, this architecture splits your app into core logic (inside the hexagon) and various adapters (outside the hexagon). This leads to:

- internal/port/: Defines interfaces (ports) for business logic.
- internal/service/: Implements business logic (adapters to ports).
- internal/handler/: gRPC handler, adapts transport to port interface.
